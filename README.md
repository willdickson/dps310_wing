# dps310_wing 

A scale model Drosophila wing  (PCB) with 52 integrated digital pressure
sensors. The sensors are arranged pairwise in 26 spanwise, cordwise position
where one sensor of each pair on the top and the other on the bottom of the
wing.  Each pair is used for differential pressure measurement.  The wing model
includes a teensy 3.5 microcontroller development board and communicates with
the host PC via USB.
