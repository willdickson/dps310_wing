# dps310_wing 

A scale model Drosophila wing  with 52 integrated digital pressure sensors. The
wing model is a single PCB and the pressure sensors are arranged pairwise in 26
spanwise, cordwise position where one sensor of each pair on the top and the
other on the bottom of the wing.  Each pair is used for differential pressure
measurement.  The wing model includes a teensy 3.5 microcontroller development
board and communicates with the host PC via USB.
